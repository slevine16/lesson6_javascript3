### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. The DOM is structured like a tree and gives Javascript the ability to create dynamic HTML. For example, JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page, change all the CSS styles in the page or remove existing HTML elements and attributes.
2. The BOM is a hierarchy of objects, where each provides programmatic access to a different aspect of the web browser window or the web page.
3. DOM includes methods to change DOM tree, to create brand new elements or to add/remove elements. A newly created node is independent of the tree and, therefore, can be attached. Additionally, one can clone pre-existing nodes. One can use insertBefore() to specify a different position for the node than the default.
